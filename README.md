# Regex Tutorial Starter Code

## Description
The primary motivation behind creating this tutorial is to address the common challenge encountered by many in understanding and implementing regex for practical purposes, such as email validation. Given that regex is a potent tool in text matching and extraction but often seen as cryptic and challenging to master, this tutorial serves as a bridge to gap this knowledge disparity.
Email validation is a prevalent necessity in data verification to ensure that received email addresses conform to standardized patterns. Wrong email formats lead to communication errors, misinformation, and data integrity issues. By leveraging regex, this tutorial provides an intricate pattern matching approach to validate email addresses accurately, ensuring they meet specific structural and syntactical criteria.
